# Start Here

This document explains how to read and interpret the work inside NDX Intelligence.

If you are new to this repository, read this file before opening experiments or notebooks.

---

## What NDX Intelligence is meant to be

NDX Intelligence is a research index, not a portfolio.

The repository is designed to preserve how understanding develops over time:
- how problems are framed
- what assumptions are made
- what fails
- what changes
- what is ultimately learned

The goal is traceability, not polish.

## How to read this repository

NDX Intelligence should be read **non-linearly**.

There is no single “main project” and no recommended completion order. Instead:

1. Start with the **index/**
2. Follow links to experiments or notebooks
3. Refer back to notes and assumptions when context is unclear

Understanding is meant to accumulate, not reset per project.

## What an experiment means here

An experiment in NDX Intelligence is not a guaranteed success.

An experiment may:
- stop early
- change direction
- contradict earlier assumptions
- remain incomplete

That is expected.

Experiments exist to test reasoning, not to produce guaranteed outcomes.

---

## Index-first structure

The **index/** directory is the stable layer of this repository.

For each experiment, the index captures:
- the original question
- assumptions made
- what failed
- what worked
- what changed in understanding

If you want a high-level view of the work, read the index files first.

## Why things may look unfinished

NDX Intelligence intentionally avoids retroactive cleanup.

You may encounter:
- rough notebooks
- partial code
- dead ends
- abandoned ideas

These are preserved to prevent loss of reasoning context.

Nothing is hidden for the sake of appearance.

## External context and walkthroughs

NDX Intelligence maintains external channels to provide additional context around the work published here.

These channels do not replace the repository.  
They point back to it.

- LinkedIn is used for research updates and announcements.
- YouTube is used for selected experiment walkthroughs and post-mortems.
- Instagram is used for visual notes, diagrams, and short reflections.

The GitHub repository remains the source of truth.

## What not to expect

This repository does not provide:
- step-by-step tutorials
- beginner learning paths
- finished products
- benchmark-focused optimization
- polished educational material

Readers looking for guided instruction should look elsewhere.

## If you are evaluating this work

If you are reading NDX Intelligence for academic or professional evaluation:

- focus on reasoning, not completeness
- follow how decisions are justified
- examine how failures are handled
- trace how assumptions evolve across experiments

That is where the signal lies.
